/*
* 
* Case: Alarm clock
* Description: A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.
* 
* My comment:
* I have some unexpected issues on my virtual machine - it does not play sounds, so I couldn't do this right way. 
* Second, this case is probably impossible to do in way that I wanted to do. I wanted to create job, which will at given
* time wrote something in output, but every job has unique session id. I wanted to wrote on output in my session, but job
* exeutes code in different session id, so it's impossible to make my way. Maybe some day I'll figure out other method.
